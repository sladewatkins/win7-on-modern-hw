List of components that I currently can't confirm 
will/will not run on Windows 7. If you know how to
assist in getting these working, please submit a pull
request and update this file with that information.

I'd love for this repository to help someone else who'd
like to also do this for fun, so I'm open sourcing this
repository.

Thank you!
